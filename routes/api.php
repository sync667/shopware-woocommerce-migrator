| The migration API uses session-based authentication instead of stateless
| API tokens, so all protected endpoints are defined in routes/web.php
| under the "api" prefix with the ValidateAccessToken middleware.
|
| This file is intentionally minimal — it is kept as the Laravel api.php
| entry point but contains no application routes.
